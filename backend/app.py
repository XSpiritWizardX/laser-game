Define `LeaveSessionRequest` (session code + player id/name key used by current store) and implement the leave handler to: remove the player, reassign host when the current host leaves, and delete the session when no players remain. Return a clear response payload with `session_exists`, `host`, and `players` so clients can update UI immediately. Include error handling for unknown session/player and idempotent behavior when a player leaves twice.
