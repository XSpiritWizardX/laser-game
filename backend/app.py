Create a request model with `session_code` plus the existing player identifier field used by the store. In the handler: validate session existence, remove the player if present, promote a new host when the old host leaves, delete the session if no players remain, and return `{session_exists, host, players}`. Make repeated leave calls for the same player safe (no crash, stable response). Return clear error payloads for unknown session and malformed input.
