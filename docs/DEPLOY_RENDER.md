# Render Deployment

This repo is set up for a Render static site using `render.yaml`.

1. In Render, create a new Blueprint instance.
2. Connect this repository and select the default branch.
3. Render will detect `render.yaml` and configure a static site.
4. Confirm the publish path is `game`.
5. Deploy.

If you prefer a manual setup, create a Static Site and set the publish directory to `game`. No build command is required.
